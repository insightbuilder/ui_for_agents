# UI Frameworks for Agents

Repo contains the code used for testing multiple
UI frameworks, or Agent Frameworks with inbuilt UI
feature.

### Following Frameworks were tested

- [Agno Reasoning Agents](agno.com)

- [CrewAI Studio](https://github.com/strnad/CrewAI-Studio)

- [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)

The three were chosen based on their ease of
immediate access as open source code. These
frameworks are referenced in many of online
discussions and forums. They support ease of
deployment, and well documented

### CrewAI Studio not Present:

The CrewAI Studio is only the Front End system
based on streamlit package in python. It did not
require any code to be written for creating the
Crews / Agents. It automates everything with the
UI. Only the crew config file has been stored in
the root of the repo.

### The discussion on Youtube:

The code from the repo is used in the Youtube
video in
[Insight Builder Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@insightbuilder),
introducing these UI features of the frameworks
